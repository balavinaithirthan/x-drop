1. figure out the size of the W matrix
W[e][k]
what is the domain of e and the domain of k
offset/k can be negative so do 2 * largest k





2. Base case
- set initial to 0
- extend step
- check for end

Every recurrence -> set, extend, check for end




for 1, max_e
    (-e, e): how do we know diagonal should be between the two
        compute W[e][k]
        how do we know W[e][k] recurrence
        extend
        check for end



1. Convert compute step into 
. compute recurrence
extend
check for end (user provides end condition?)

Step 1:
convert S[i][j] to W[e][k] with extend
